.Op Fl i | Fl c | Fl k Ar p12_file Op Ar password
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an EFI application designed to manage TPM platform keys during EFI runtime.
It can be used to show TPM status, clear the TPM, and install platform keys from P12 files.
.Pp
The application is designed to run from the EFI shell when the TPM is in platform setup mode.
It supports both TPM 1.2 and 2.0 devices and can parse P12 files without OpenSSL dependency.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl i , Fl -info
Show detailed TPM information, including:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
TPM version and manufacturer
.It
Maximum RSA key size
.It
Number of PCR banks
.It
Platform hierarchy status
.It
Setup mode status
.It
Auth settings for all hierarchies
.El
.It Fl c , Fl -clear
Clear the TPM and reset it to factory state.
This operation:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Requires platform hierarchy to be enabled
.It
Requires user confirmation
.It
Cannot be undone
.El
.It Fl k Ar p12_file , Fl -install-pk Ar p12_file
Install a platform key from the specified P12 file.
The optional password parameter is used if the P12 file is password-protected.
.It Fl v , Fl -verbose
Enable verbose output. Multiple instances increase verbosity level.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Show TPM information:
.Dl pkinstall.efi -i
.Pp
Clear TPM (requires confirmation):
.Dl pkinstall.efi --clear
.Pp
Install platform key from P12 file:
.Dl pkinstall.efi -k platform_key.p12
.Pp
Install password-protected platform key:
.Dl pkinstall.efi -k platform_key.p12 mypassword
.Pp
Show detailed TPM information with verbose output:
.Dl pkinstall.efi -v -i

The
.Nm
utility was written by
.An "Paige Thompson" .
.Sh BUGS
The P12 file parsing functionality is currently a placeholder and needs to be implemented.
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
The clear TPM operation is a destructive operation that cannot be undone.
It should only be performed when absolutely necessary and with proper authorization.
.Pp
Platform key installation should only be performed when the TPM is in platform setup mode
and with proper authorization.
