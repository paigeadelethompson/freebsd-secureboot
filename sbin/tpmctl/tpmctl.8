.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B tpmctl
utility provides a command-line interface for managing TPM (Trusted Platform Module) devices
on FreeBSD systems. It supports both TPM 1.2 and 2.0 devices, and can be used to list
available TPM devices, show detailed TPM information, and install platform keys.
.PP
The utility supports both CRB (Command Response Buffer) and TIS (TIS Interface Specification)
interfaces, with CRB being the preferred interface for TPM 2.0 devices.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-info\fR
Show detailed TPM information, including:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
TPM version (1.2 or 2.0)
.IP \(bu 2
Manufacturer ID
.IP \(bu 2
Maximum RSA key size
.IP \(bu 2
Number of PCR banks
.IP \(bu 2
TPM state
.IP \(bu 2
Platform hierarchy status
.IP \(bu 2
Setup mode status
.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-install\-pk\fR
Install a platform key from the specified P12 file. This option requires a P12 file
to be specified as an argument.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\-devices\fR
List all available TPM devices, showing their paths and interface types (CRB or TIS).
.TP
\fB\-\-device\fR \fInum\fR
Select a specific TPM device by number (0-based). This is useful when multiple TPM
devices are available on the system.
.TP
\fB\-\-tis\fR
Force the use of the TIS interface instead of the CRB interface. This is useful for
legacy TPM 1.2 devices that only support TIS.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Enable verbose output. Multiple instances of this option increase the verbosity level:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-v\fR: Basic operation status messages
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-vv\fR: Detailed progress information
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-vvv\fR: Technical details and internal state
.RE
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-password\fR \fIpass\fR
Specify the password for the P12 file. If not provided, the utility will prompt for
the password when needed.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Display usage information and exit.
.TP
\fIp12_file\fR
The path to the P12 file containing the platform key to install. This argument is
required when using the \fB\-\-install\-pk\fR option.
.SH EXAMPLES
List available TPM devices:
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ tpmctl -l
.fi
.RE
.PP
Show detailed TPM information:
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ tpmctl -i
.fi
.RE
.PP
Install a platform key with verbose output:
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ tpmctl --install-pk -v platform_key.p12
.fi
.RE
.PP
Install a platform key with a password:
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ tpmctl --install-pk -w mypassword platform_key.p12
.fi
.RE
.PP
Use a specific TPM device with maximum verbosity:
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ tpmctl -i --device 1 -vvv
.fi
.RE
.SH EXIT STATUS
The
.B tpmctl
utility exits with one of the following values:
.TP
\fB0\fR
Success.
.TP
\fB1\fR
An error occurred during execution.
.TP
\fB2\fR
Invalid command line arguments.
